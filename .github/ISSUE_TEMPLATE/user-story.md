**A good user story should be (I-N-V-E-S-T principle)**

* _Independent_ (from other user stories, allowing to realize them in any order);
* _Negotiable_ (omit details that would freeze the story);
* _Valuable_ (implementation delivers an increment of functionality, observable by and useful to users);
* _Estimable_ (developers should be able to estimate its size relative to other stories);
* _Sizable_ (implementation fits in one iteration – if it needs many to complete, it is an EPIC);
* _Testable_ (user must be able to check the conditions of satisfaction).

### Description
*As a ‹role›, I'd like to ‹feature short description› [ , in order to ‹value it adds›. ]*





### Acceptance Criteria
Reference: [Done-Done Checklist] (https://github.com/Microsoft/code-with-engineering-playbook/blob/master/Engineering/BestPractices/DoneDone.md)
- [ ] Should ‹testable condition that should be satisfied›
- [ ] Should ‹testable condition that should be satisfied›
- [ ] …



Also, here are a few points that need to be addressed:

1. Constraint 1;
1. Constraint 2;
1. Constraint 3.



### Resources
*Technical Design Document*
*Mockups*


### Tasks
*Stories are intended to be completed in a single sprint; if task breakdown creates addition work then team should discuss promoting the Story to an Epic.
